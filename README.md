(In Progress) Simple SPA that allows the user to register and manage notes. The goal of the project is apply and consolidate the basic React concepts like component creation, component hierarchy, data passing between components, basic hooks and state management.
I used react-fontawesome and CSS flexbox too.
It is not saving data on a data base but for now.
